    <p>At RUDIMENT, we appreciate the notion of humble workwear such as the apron, jumpsuit and shirt. Aprons protect those working for 
    others. Jumpsuits provide utilitarian conformity amid a hard day’s work. Crisp, clean shirts represent a fresh start towards a new day. These hardworking everyday items aren’t indicators of age, gender or nationality. They represent uniform practicality while conveying a mastery of skill. We work with these ordinary objects to create something extraordinary.</p>

    <p>We focus on shirting as our beginning.</p>
